					<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
					<p></p>
					<p>Last updated: June 28, 2023</p>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-8">
					<h4>Why is nobody chatting? Is anyone reading this?</h4>
					<p>Most likely, yes. Economics discord has users within the community that come from all parts of
						the world from Mongolia to
						Kenya, Norway and Peru to name a few. Because of the difference in schedules there is not any
						particular hour that is the
						most active. Users send hundreds of messages in our server community every day. If you wait a
						little, someone will most
						likely engage in the chat.</p><br>
					<h4>I need help with my economics/statistics/applied math homework, can I ask for help?</h4>
					<p>Yes, absolutely. Providing help for these topics is one of our main missions or goals in the
						server. Our rules require that you
						have at least made an attempt to complete the work, in other words, we are not going to do the
						work for you.</p><br>
					<h4>I have a question about economics or economies. Can I ask it?</h4>
					<p>Yes! Please ask your general questions about economics either in the general chat, in #econ_help
						or in a topical channel.<br>
						You do not need to seek permission to ask questions and it is easier for us to answer if you
						just post your question directly.</p><br>
					<h4>I have a question about politics or political ideologies. Can I ask it?</h4>
					<p>No!</p><br>
					<h4>There are so many channels! Where should I post my questions?</h4>
					<p>Try to use the channel which seems most appropriate, though as a default the #econ_help channel
						is always good to ask
						questions. Broader questions or questions which might interest the larger community can be asked
						in #general_chat.</p><br>
					<h4>A friend or I believe they were wrongfully banned from the server, is there any capacity to
						reinstate a user in this case?</h4>
					<p>Yes. There is a process for reinstatement of users who were previously banned from the server. <br>
						However this process is very
						rarely used and most cases are documented rules violations with little or no need to revisit the
						circumstances of the removal.</p><br>
					<h4>Can I discuss significant current events?</h4>
					<p>Yes with some caveats. In order to streamline the operation of the server, minimize the need for
						moderation and to maintain a
						specific focus of the server we ask that you discuss current events only insofar as it relates
						to the current or historical
						economic context.</p><br>
					<h4>Why do you hate Austrian and heterodox economics?</h4>
					<p>
						Many of us are aware of the ideas of Austrian economics. In direct contrast with Austrian
						economics views, we choose to
						focus our time on methods and theories that are supported by extensive data collection and
						rigorous econometric analysis.<br>
						There are many other outlets on the internet for discussing Austrian economics that would be
						more suitable than our server.<br>
						In terms of policy, to the best of our knowledge the only valid analysis of policies is
						quantitative analysis that utilizes advanced
						econometrics techniques.
					</p><br>

					<h4>I want to know how to get accepted to graduate school in economics. How do I do that?</h4>
					<p>
						In economics there are primarily two types of graduate programs, a master's in economics and a
						doctor of philosophy (PhD)
						in economics. In broad terms, individuals who get a PhD often plan to take jobs as professors at
						universities or doing
						advanced research in non-profit organizations. Master's programs in economics prepare most
						students to be professional
						economists and equip them with the basic tools of economics and econometrics that are necessary
						to be a functioning
						professional economist. To get accepted to most graduate programs you must complete the graduate
						entrance examination
						known as the GRE.
					</p><br>

					<h4>I want to know how to get accepted to graduate school in economics, can I ask you about my
						background?</h4>
					<p>
						In general, questions about specific programs or a specific individual's background are not
						permitted. One reason is because
						this information is not particularly useful to other users. First-hand accounts of user's
						experiences are allowed.
					</p><br>

					<h4>I have a question about advanced econometric methods. Can you answer it?</h4>
					<p>
						We will do our best. Please recognize that even econometrics as a sub-discipline is very broad
						and involves a wide range of
						techniques. It is very rare for any single individual to be trained and skilled in all of those
						areas in both the theoretical and
						applied sense. The vast majority of questions about econometrics we receive relate to applied
						econometric analysis.
					</p><br>

					<h4>I study or work in finance but I don't know much about economics. How do economics and finance
						relate?</h4>
					<p>
						Finance is strongly related to or even part of economics. Some aspects of the analysis of
						financial markets that relate to
						economics and are particularly important are: central banks, banking and financial regulation
						and foreign exchange/sovereign
						debt. Often, financial analysts use time series analysis, which is a type of statistical
						(econometric) modeling used for
						forecasting. <br>
						Quantitative traders may use time series techniques or more advanced econometric
						models. Financial analysis is
						most closely related to macroeconomic analysis, though microeconometric techniques and
						microeconomic models are also
						used to model asset prices in what is known as the "microeconomics of finance." <br>
						Econometrics, in
						particular, is a useful tool
						for individuals looking to enter into quantitative analysis or algorithmic trading. According to
						the course description in one
						particularly well-known program:<br>
						"Quantitative methods have become fundamental tools in the analysis and planning of financial
						operations... . .. In this
						course, models for hedging, asset a/location, and multi-period portfolio planning are developed,
						implemented, and
						tested. In addition, pricing models for options, bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and other
						derivatives are studied.
						The models typically require the tools of statistics, optimization, and/or simulation, and they
						are implemented in
						spreadsheets or a high-level modeling environment, MATLAB. <br>
						This course is quantitative and will
						require extensive computer use. The course is intended for students who have strong interest in
						finance. The objective is to provide
						students the necessary practical tools they will require should they choose to join the
						financial services industry,
						particularly in roles such as: derivatives, quantitative trading, portfolio management,
						structuring, financial engineering,
						risk management, etc."<br>
